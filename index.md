DockSec is an AI-powered Docker security analyzer that provides automated vulnerability detection, intelligent remediation suggestions, and compliance enforcement for containerized applications. It combines traditional static analysis tools (like Trivy, Hadolint, and Docker Bench) with advanced AI capabilities to identify security misconfigurations, hardcoded secrets, outdated dependencies, and vulnerable base images within Dockerfiles and container images.

Unlike conventional scanners, DockSec offers a developer-friendly experience by integrating directly into CI/CD pipelines and IDEs (such as VS Code), delivering real-time, context-aware security insights. It generates structured security reports in multiple formats (JSON, CSV, HTML, PDF) and provides actionable recommendations based on best practices and compliance benchmarks.

The tool is fully open source and designed to support DevSecOps teams seeking to shift security left in the container lifecycle. DockSec aims to raise the security baseline of modern cloud-native applications by making secure containerization accessible, intelligent, and automated.
